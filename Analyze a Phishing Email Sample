* Sender's Email Address:
support@apple-account-security.com

Spoofing? Yes. The domain is not an official Apple domain. Real Apple emails come from @apple.com or @id.apple.com.

* Suspicious Links or Attachments:
Link:
https://apple.security-lock.com/verify

Often, these redirect to phishing sites that mimic Apple’s login page.

Urgent or Threatening Language:
“We detected suspicious activity”

“Your account has been locked”

This pressure is a common scare tactic to get users to act without thinking.
